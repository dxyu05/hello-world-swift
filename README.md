# Prework - Hello World

Submitted by: Daniel Yu

Hello World is my first app in Swift which I created for the iOS course prework.

Time spent: 1 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [X] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## Video Walkthrough

Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite apps and some of my favorite features:

1) Youtube
   - The recommendation algorithm, I discover a lot of new creators and videos that I really enjoy and
     I can't imagine how much time is dedicated towards improving their search/recommendation algorithm continuously...
   - The whole streaming videos capabilities is something a lot of people would not have thought possible just 20 years ago and has advanced modern life tremendously in my opinion
   - Their UI has stood the test of time and is pretty minimalistic which I like
2) Discord
   - Friends list :D
   - I think messaging apps are really cool, discord especially because of servers and voice calls
   - I love that they are unique from other social media apps in that you can customize your server and add things like bots among others..
3) Reddit
   - I like the idea behind reddit because it is one of the first platforms to have a forum style social media, I like the idea behind subreddits/dedicated communities
   - r/place is a really cool thing that they do every so often I think during April Fools? Every user gets to place tile every 5 minutes and the result of the challenge has been cool every time
   - I like how you can add reddit bots.. like in some subreddits theyy have a bot to post sporting event scores

## Notes

I had a little bit of trouble figuring out how Xcode works but otherwise it was smooth sailing. I like how you can just drag UI elements instead of styling using a language like CSS.
